<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

The Recipe Application allows you to access over 365,000 recipes and 86,000 food products through the spoonacular API. Their food ontology and semantic recipe search engine makes it possible to search for recipes using natural language queries, such as “gluten free brownies without sugar” or “low fat vegan cupcakes.” You can automatically calculate the nutritional information for any recipe, analyze recipe costs, visualize ingredient lists, find recipes for what’s in your fridge, find recipes based on special diets, nutritional requirements, or favorite ingredients, classify recipes into types and cuisines, convert ingredient amounts, or even compute an entire meal plan. With their powerful API, you can create many kinds of food and especially nutrition apps.


Here's some use cases where this application would be useful:
* You have ingredients to make multiple meals but you are indecisive on which one to make so you go into the app and explore the meals and check the time and ingeridients of each meal.
* You know what you want to make but you are unsure of the process
* You want to know if a specific meals fit your taste and allergies.
